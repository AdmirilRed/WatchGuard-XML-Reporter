# WatchGuard-XML-Reporter
Generates METADATA reports from WatchGuard Video

 This program is intended to generate reports from XML files created by the 
WatchGuard video service. It searches for all XML files within a directory
and stores the Officer's name, the vehicle, the category of encounter,
and the video ID in a CSV file. If you encounter any issues or need to
request a feature, please contact me at JManahan@cityofrockport.com
